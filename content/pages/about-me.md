I have over 11 years of expertise in software engineering. My skills and knowledge span a wide range of areas, including .NET, RESTful services, software architecture, microservices, Azure, React.JS, Next.JS, Angular, JavaScript, SQL and NoSQL databases. In my free time, I like developing side projects and learning new technologies.
