As a dedicated and versatile Computer Science student at California State University, Northridge, I bring a robust blend of academic excellence, practical experience, and innovative problem-solving skills to the field of software engineering. With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development, I have consistently demonstrated my ability to deliver impactful solutions across various projects and internships. My experience ranges from engineering high-performance web applications that significantly boost client engagement to architecting complex database systems that handle intricate data relationships. I thrive in collaborative environments, having led Agile development teams and contributed to open-source projects. My technical proficiency spans a wide array of programming languages and frameworks, including JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, and Python, complemented by a solid understanding of cloud technologies and containerization. Beyond technical skills, I possess a keen analytical mind, excellent communication abilities, and a relentless drive for continuous learning and improvement. Whether it's optimizing system performance, crafting intuitive user interfaces, or tackling complex algorithmic challenges, I approach each task with enthusiasm and a commitment to excellence.
