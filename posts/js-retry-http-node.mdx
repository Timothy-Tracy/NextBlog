In a world where networks can be fickle, and servers can unexpectedly take naps, we find the need to become adept at dealing with intermittent failures in our HTTP requests. One effective technique for handling these types of failures is the retry mechanism. In the realm of JavaScript and NodeJS, a popular library to manage retries is axios-retry. This article will introduce you to the practice of retrying HTTP requests using axios-retry with the key aspects of delay and exponential backoff.

## Understanding Retrying and the Need for Delays and Backoffs

A naive approach to HTTP request retry would be to simply resend the request whenever a failure occurs. This method, however, can exacerbate the problem, potentially turning a minor glitch into a catastrophic failure. It's like poking a sleepy bear; the more you do it, the more likely you're going to get a reaction you don't want.

A more refined approach involves adding a delay between retry attempts and using an exponential backoff strategy. These two aspects allow for a more gentle, respectful interaction with the server. They give the server some breathing room, reducing the likelihood of exacerbating the problem.

## Retry in JavaScript and NodeJS with Axios-Retry

Axios is a promise-based HTTP client that works in both browser and Node.js environments. The axios-retry library augments Axios with a robust, configurable retry mechanism.

Here is a simple example of how to use axios-retry:

```js
const axios = require('axios');
const axiosRetry = require('axios-retry');

// Creating an axios instance and configuring retry
const client = axios.create();
axiosRetry(client, { retries: 3 });

client.get('https://example.com/api/data')
  .then(response => console.log(response.data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Failed after 3 attempts', error));
```

In this example, if the HTTP request fails, it's retried up to three times. After three failures, the promise is rejected and the error is logged.

## Adding Delays and Exponential Backoff

The axios-retry library allows you to configure a delay between retry attempts and to use an exponential backoff strategy. Exponential backoff increases the wait time between retries exponentially, further reducing the risk of overloading a struggling server.

The delay and backoff configuration can be done using a custom retryDelay function. The library provides a default exponential delay function which you can use directly:

```js
const axios = require('axios');
const axiosRetry = require('axios-retry');

const client = axios.create();

axiosRetry(client, { 
  retries: 3,
  retryDelay: axiosRetry.exponentialDelay
});

client.get('https://example.com/api/data')
  .then(response => console.log(response.data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Failed after 3 attempts', error));

```

With this configuration, if the initial request fails, the first retry will wait for a delay of 100ms, the second retry will wait for around 200ms, and the third for approximately 400ms.

In conclusion, when performing HTTP requests in JavaScript or NodeJS, applying a retry mechanism using the axios-retry library can enhance your application's resilience against intermittent network or server issues. By incorporating delay and exponential backoff strategies, you can mitigate the risk of overloading your servers and offer a better, more reliable experience to your users.
